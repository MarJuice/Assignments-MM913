1.  Implement a Start Screen
    Create a basic start screen with an option to start the game. The game should not start until the user chooses to do so.

2.  Implement a Game Replay Option
    After a game concludes, navigate back to the start screen. The user should have the option to play again or exit the game.Test the functionality to ensure it works as expected.

3.  Support Multiple Languages
    Modify your game to support an additional language. Once you have successfully implemented dual-language support, expand your game to support multiple languages.

4.  Refactor Your Code
    After implementing all the above features, review your code for potential improvements. Your goal is to make your code more readable, and maintainable.
    It is a god idea to document your refactoring decisions and the reasons behind them in the readme file.
